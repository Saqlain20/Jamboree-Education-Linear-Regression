# Jamboree-Education-Linear-Regression
Predicting chances of admission using Linear Regression

1) Performed EDA, necessary data pre-processing, built a Linear Regression model with complaince to its assumptions and tested the model on multiple metrices while comparing them. 

2) Applied regularisation techniques and performed hyperparameter tuning to get the best model.

3) Performed feature importance and recommended which features are important and which are not to predict the chances of admission and hence can be dropped from the analysis.

4) Sucessfully built a model with MSE : 0.0033 & RMSE :0.0582.

5) Keywords : Linear Regression, sklearn, statsmodel library, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.

P.S. - Insights and Recommendations are within the python notebook.
